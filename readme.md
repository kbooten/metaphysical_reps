# Metaphysical Reps

🏋️

An interface for poetic training.  It guides the user to metaphorically consider a key term (such as "truth" or "error") in light of a metaphorical vehicle (such as a "friar" or a "car"); it does this by generating the beginnings of lines that describe things that are typically possessed by the vehicle (e.g. the "sermon" of the "friar").
